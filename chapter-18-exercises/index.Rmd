# This is my **report**!

This is the code we will look at in class. Thisis just plain old Markdown that lets you rendertext in **bold** or _italics_. However, you canput in a block of R code, and the document willshow the code and the results!

```{r exmaple, include = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)

numbers_mean <- mean(numbers) # Get the mean of numbers

letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)
# "return" the table to render it
kable(df)
```

The mean of the number happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**.

```{r other_chuck, echo = FALSE}
print(numbers)
````
